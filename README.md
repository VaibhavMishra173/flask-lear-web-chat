# Flask-Learn-Web-Chat

This repository serves as a learning project created during college to explore and understand the core functionalities of Flask, a lightweight and versatile Python web framework.

## About the Project
The purpose of this project was to gain hands-on experience with building web applications using Flask. It includes the implementation of basic chat functionality, routing, and templating, providing a foundation for developing interactive web applications.

## Features
- Real-time web chat functionality.
- Basic routing and request handling.
- Template rendering with Flask.
- Integration of static files (CSS, JS).

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Programming language used for application logic.
- **Flask**: Lightweight web framework for building the application.
- **HTML/CSS**: For creating user interfaces.
- **JavaScript**: For client-side interactivity.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- [Python](https://www.python.org/) installed on your system.

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd flask-learn-web-chat
   ```
3. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```
4. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Usage
1. Run the Flask development server:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
2. Open your browser and visit:
   ```
   http://localhost:5000
   ```

## Learning Objectives
- Understanding the basics of Flask.
- Implementing routing and rendering templates.
- Managing static files for front-end interactivity.
- Building foundational features for web chat functionality.
